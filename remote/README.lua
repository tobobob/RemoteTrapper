?? RTT (Public Release)

Hey! Thanks for using my script! I appreciate it ??
You need to accomodate this script with your current structure by wiring them together, change the paths of the preset -
-- folders to your liking, aswell as the whitelisted userids, and the webhook url

?? Modes:
- "warn": Output a warning
- "kick": Kick the user
- "ban": Ban the user

The default mode is set to "warn", however you can change this to your liking in Init, change the string mode = "" with your desired mode
